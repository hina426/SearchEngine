## Features

- Forward indexing
- Inverted indexing
- Lexicon
- Single and multi-word search
- Page Rank algorithm
- Scalability

## Setup and Usage

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository

Afterward get following libraries:

1-Punkt Tokenizer Model
2-Stopwords Corpus

By typing: 

import nltk

nltk.download()

To use the search engine, simply type your search query into the search bar and press the "Search" button. The search engine will return a list of relevant results based on your query.

## Implementation

The search engine uses the following algorithms:

#### Forward indexing: 
This algorithm is used to map documents to words.

#### Inverted indexing: 
This algorithm is used to create a reverse index of the documents, mapping each word to the list of documents it appears in.

#### Lexicon: 
This is a list of all the unique words in the documents, used for efficient searching.

#### Single and multi-word search: 
The search engine supports both single and multi-word searches, allowing users to search for multiple words at once.

#### Page Rank algorithm:
This algorithm is used to rank the documents based on their importance and relevance to the search query.

#### Scalability: 
The search engine has been designed to scale to large amounts of data and handle a high volume of search queries.


## Technologies

This project is built using the following frameworks:

- HTML for the structure of the web page
- CSS for the styling of the web page
- Python for the backend logic and implementation of the search engine
- Flask for the web framework
